## [What to Do](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/#what-to-do)

1.  Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2.  Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3.  Submit [Readability](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/readability/)
4.  Submit one of:
    -   [Caesar](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/caesar/), if feeling less comfortable
    -   [Substitution](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/substitution/), if feeling more comfortable

If you submit both Caesar and Substitution, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## [Advice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/#advice)

-   Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/2/)’s examples.
-   To see the manual pages for C functions, visit [manual.cs50.io](https://manual.cs50.io/).
-   If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `readability`, and
    ```
    make readability
    ```
    is yielding errors, try running
    ```
    help50 make readability
    ```
    instead!
