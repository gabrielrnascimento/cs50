## [What to Do](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/#what-to-do)

1.  Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own “codespace” for Visual Studio Code
2.  Once your codespace has loaded, close any **Welcome** tabs that might have opened by default
3.  In Codespace’s terminal, complete the steps under **SSH** at [cs50.readthedocs.io/github/#ssh](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/github/#ssh) to configure your codespace for some of CS50’s command-line tools
4.  Log into [submit.cs50.io](https://submit.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account and click **Authorize** to activate check50.
5.  Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
6.  Submit [Hello](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/hello/)
7.  Submit one of:
    -   [this version of Mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/mario/less/) if feeling less comfortable
    -   [this version of Mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/mario/more/) if feeling more comfortable
8.  Submit one of:
    -   [Cash](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/cash/) if feeling less comfortable

## [Advice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/#advice)

-   Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/1/)’s source code.
-   See CS50’s [style guide for C](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style/c/) for tips on how to improve your code’s style.
-   If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `hello`, and
    
    is yielding errors, try running
    
    instead!
